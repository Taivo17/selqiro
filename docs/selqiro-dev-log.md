# Selqiro development log

## 2026-06-26

### Premium / identity admin
- Added admin identities overview.
- Added admin identity detail page.
- Fixed dynamic route `/admin/identities/[identityId]`.
- Admin can set identity plan: `free`, `premium`, `business`.
- Plan is stored in `identity_profiles.plan`.
- Confirmed admin detail refresh keeps `premium`.

### My Page refactor
- `app/my-page/page.tsx` is currently very large, about 2559 lines.
- Decision: refactor My Page into smaller modules and components.
- First component: `app/my-page/components/MembershipCard.tsx`.
- Goal: make future maintenance easier and reduce risk when editing.

### Architecture decision
- Prefer smaller components and hooks.
- Avoid very large files.
- Future structure should move logic into hooks and UI into components.

### Engineering principles
- Adopted Selqiro official development style.
- Added ChatGPT-friendly architecture principle.
- Added development planning rule.
- Added 10-year architecture principle.
- Future development should prioritize modularity, maintainability, clear responsibilities, and easy debugging.
